Our drivers, Asanka and Sahlan, were extremely kind, friendly and always did their best to satisfy all our demands. We felt very safe. The car was clean and confortable and we couldn't wish for a better service. On the top of that, after checking with more than douzain of travel agencies, price was the most competitive. Go for it !!!!!!" },
